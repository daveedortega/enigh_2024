# X DECIL ANALYSIS FROM ENIGH

Honestly I find myslef time and again getting mad at ENIGH because the larger picture shows a very grim and not at all accessible panorama.
I read the analysis in the result presentation and I always ask myself about the tenth decil of the income distribution. 
Because Mexico is an immensely unequal country I feel like I want to look into how this income bracket is different than others, specially in CDMX. 

So this is that. 

It should become a Quatro ppt. 
yeah.
